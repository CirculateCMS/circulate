## What is Circulate?

Circulate is designed to make it as **easy as possible** for developers to create awesome websites. By using familiar technologies and a simple tech stack, Circulate allows developers to accelerate the process of getting a new website up and running in as short a time as possible.

Circulate is different from most other traditional content management systems (e.g. WordPress) in that is uses a "flat-file" system to store content and data instead of a database. There are several advantages to doing this:

* **It's easier to install** - You don't need to worry about installing MySQL or some other database software.
* **It's faster** - Without the overhead of running and querying a database, things run much quicker.
* **It's safer** - Running less software makes you less vulnerable to being hacked (e.g. no MySQL injection attacks).
* **It's easier to manage** - All of your content can be committed to version control and deployed almost anywhere.

Also, many flat-file CMSs are overwhelming and force you to learn new or unfamiliar technologies to be able to get the best out of them. Circulate aims to be different by being as **simple** and as **flexible** possible. We achieve this by using a stack that is made up of very popular and familiar technologies: PHP, Markdown and Blade templates.
